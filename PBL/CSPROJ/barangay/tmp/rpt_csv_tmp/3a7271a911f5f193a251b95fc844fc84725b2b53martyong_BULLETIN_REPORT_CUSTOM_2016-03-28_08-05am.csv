7,"Good Manners","Children and adults who have good manners are pleasant to be with and we generally tend to want to spend more time in the company of well-mannered folks.

Over the years I have had enjoyed visiting many different schools and I am always curious as to the neatness of the campus and the perception of good manners in the school. First impressions are important."
